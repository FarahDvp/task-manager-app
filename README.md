# task-manager-app
A task management application that allows users to create, update, categorize, and track tasks with due dates, while supporting user authentication, role-based access, and detailed reporting. 

## Key features:

- Task Management: Users can create, update, categorize, and track tasks with due dates. Tasks can be prioritized, updated, and marked as completed based on user interaction.
- User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control: The system supports secure login and user registration, with role-based access control to define permissions and ensure that different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) have appropriate access to the systemâ€™s features.
- Detailed Reporting: The application provides users with valuable insights into their tasks through detailed reports, including task completion rates, overdue tasks, and progress tracking.
- End-to-End and Unit Testing: The application has a comprehensive testing suite to ensure stability and reliability. Karma and Jasmine are used for unit testing, while Cypress is employed for end-to-end testing, ensuring the app functions as expected across different scenarios.

The development process integrates continuous integration tools such as GitLab CI for automated testing, building, and deployment. SonarQube is also used to monitor and improve code quality, identifying potential issues like bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. This combination of modern technologies and best practices ensures that the application is both high-performance and maintainable.

This application serves as a complete solution for task management, offering powerful features for both individual and team productivity, while ensuring a seamless, secure, and optimized user experience.
